Javascript Example for the Ungerboeck API 
==========================

This is an example of a javascript call with JWT to GET an account.

# How To Run
Simply edit the values inside the html file to point to your API User ID, key, secret and Ungerboeck URL.  You can find these in the API User window within Ungerboeck (after making an API User, of course).

Then run the html in a browser.
